# AAICO February 2024 Voice Processing Challenge

## Welcome

Welcome to the AAICO January 2024 Voice Processing Challenge! This repository contains the necessary resources and information to participate in the challenge. Please read the following guidelines to ensure a smooth and successful participation.

### Challenge Overview

The challenge involves completing the '**aaico_voice_processing_challenge.py**' file. This file simulates the streaming of the '**audio_aaico_challenge.wav**' audio file. Frame by frame, the "emit_data" thread emits the data of the audio file. Each frame consists of 512 samples, with a sample rate of 16000 Hz for the audio file.

The "process_data" thread receives these frames. Your task is to complete the code in this thread to label each received sample and save your label using the provided function "label_samples". A sample should be labeled 0 if it is detected as a command, otherwise 1 (we consider that everything that is not a command should be broadcast).

Once the code is executed, a '**results.pkl**' file will be saved, which is an array containing for each sample:

- The time at which the sample was emitted.
- The label you assigned to the sample.
- The time at which the sample was labelled.

More details on the challenge are provided here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nacv8gT2kfG2wGWXIdKaisStBy2xfGPJIGy27AqqEo4.

You can evaluate your results directly on Colab in which the scoring method is fully explicit: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ekMF1UFfr3djseliJleUNpvzfyIJP57G?usp=sharing by uploading the results.pkl file (along with the audio_aaico_challenge.wav file).
